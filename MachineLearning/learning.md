## Zero-shot Learning

Given labeled training instances $D^{tr}$ belonging to the seen classes $S$, zero-shot learning aims to learn a classifier $f^u(\cdot):X \rightarrow u$ that can classify testing instances $X^{te}$ (i.e. to predict $Y^{te}$) belonging to the unseen classes $u$

## Few-shot Learning

Few-shot learning is a type of machine learning (specified by $E$, $T$ and $P$), where $E$ contains only a limited number of examples with supervised information for the target $T$
